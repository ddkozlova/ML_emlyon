Here I tried to create a user interface to monitor hate level in public opinion on Twitter on any topic.

File UI.py contains the interface itself and should be run with *streamlit run UI.py" in the comand prompt.
File train_select_model.ipynb shows the process of ML model training. This model is then used in UI.py
